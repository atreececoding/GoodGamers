# GoodGamers - college project
The Good Gamers database to help you find your new adventure. This application uses React.js for the front end
and Node.js for the backend with express to connect to the database. The goal is to have two different types of search:
one searches for a specific game and the other uses buttons to search for things like company names, genres, art styles, etc.
